# Tunite

OVERVIEW

Hi everyone! We’re team Tunite.  So we all listen to music, but who wants to listen to the same mainstream songs all the time? And as upcoming music creators, who doesn’t want to be heard?  For indie artists, it’s extremely hard to rise up when your music is constantly getting buried and unnoticed in this highly saturated space. 

Without the resources and social networks reserved for the top, talented musicians rely on word of mouth for recognition with both fans and community.

So we ask ourselves, how can we improve indie artists’ experience in creating and sharing music, so that they can gain recognition and build connections easily, thus breaking into the industry? 

To answer this question, we created Tunite, a collaboration platform that unites indie artists for social music creation. With Tunite, we are happy to say, “Indie artists, you are not alone!”

Tunite helps increase your discoverability, build your network, and pursue higher quality music projects simply by collaborating with anyone online.

Tunite allows indie artists to explore new music from their community, and provides them the opportunity to discover potential collaborators.  

Using our explore feature, quickly scan many versions of a single song, then save your favorites for future collaboration. The best collaborations help unite indie artists. 

Finally, you control the flow of your projects. Tunite lets producers promote the next best version of their songs. Your music inspires your community to evolve what you’ve shared, and if you like what you hear, it’s time to make a new connection.
 
Tunite is a collaboration platform that unites indie artists for social music creation. Talented indie artists will benefit from the ability to make meaningful collaborations, rise above the noise of a saturated market, and allow us, casual music lovers, to diversify our mainstream playlists.

 TECH STACK DECISIONS
 
 We decided to use react native for mobile because of its ability to create quick prototypes and fast development time. Using reactn ative, we were also able to create a web version using similar technique. Overall, we chose our technology based on what provides the shortest development time.
